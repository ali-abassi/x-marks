# X Marks

Clean up your X/Twitter feed.

## What it does

**Clean View** removes everything except what matters:
- No right sidebar
- No ads or promoted tweets
- No Grok
- No trending
- No "who to follow"
- Just Profile and Bookmarks in the nav

**Hide Videos** removes all video posts from your feed.

**Copy Bookmarks** adds a copy button to each bookmarked tweet. One click copies the author, content, and URL to your clipboard — ready to paste into Claude, ChatGPT, or wherever.

## Install

Or load manually:
1. Download this repo
